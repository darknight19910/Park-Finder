			further details along with url to support my claim has been added to comment rule of css file

		ii) background-position-x: in search.css  
			further details has been added to the comment rule of css file
		
		The reason: the pointer and background-position has been moved to the CSS4. The CSS3 Validator Service
		            are unable to detect the existence of the element or selector. I have testeed in Firefox, Explorer
			    and Chrome browser, they are all working fine and correctly.
